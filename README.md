Hire Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a staffer for **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex** and **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code).

## What & Why

agy-staff lets your senior agents delegate to `agy`, which ships fast Gemini 3.7 Flash. Five personas, one plugin name on both platforms: `/agy:staffer` (general-purpose), `/agy:researcher`, `/agy:reviewer` (code **and** plans/decisions), `/agy:implementer`, `/agy:ask` — plus a model-facing `jobs` skill that manages the background jobs (`wait`/`status`/`result`/`cancel`/`continue`/`setup`).

If you use Codex you know the feeling: GPT-5.6-Sol is slow even with fast mode on. Claude Code is quicker but still not fast, and Fable quota is scarce enough that you want it orchestrating subagents, not grinding through every survey and review itself. An agy worker gives you a fast lane — second opinions in seconds, research and reviews at Flash speed, scoped implementation handled off to the side while you keep moving. And where speed isn't the point, a second model family looking at the same code buys coverage and robustness your main agent can't give itself.

## How

Type `/agy:` in Claude Code and the five personas are right there:

Same plugin in Codex, invoked with `$agy`:

### Install

#### For humans

Step 1 — install the Antigravity CLI ([official docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install)), then verify with `agy --version` (tested with v1.1.15; Node.js is also required):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Step 2 — install the plugin into your harness:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add keli-wen/agy-staff
claude plugin install agy@agy-staff
```

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/keli-wen/agy-staff
codex plugin add agy@agy-staff
```

Restart the harness afterwards so the skills load, then first run: `/agy:ask "reply with OK"` — ask is tool-free and works with zero setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There is no mandatory setup step.** `staffer`, `researcher`, `reviewer` and `implementer` run **unrestricted** by default: agy gathers evidence and edits files on its own, guarded by the prompt templates (no commits/pushes, no costly side effects) plus a clean-git-tree check on `implementer`.
> `setup` + `--restricted` is **optional hardening** for untrusted input — per run (`--restricted`) or as a per-repo default (`setup --restrict review,research`). `setup` dry-runs and asks before writing anything ("set up agy" triggers it); read the [permission notes](docs/REFERENCE.md#optional-hardening-setup) first — the allowlist is prefix-matched, applies machine-wide, and a restricted run can return less than an unrestricted one.

#### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

Copilot has no marketplace or plugin mechanism — skills are plain directories it reads off disk — so a script copies them out of a checkout instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keli-wen/agy-staff.git
cd agy-staff
./scripts/install-copilot.sh             # account-wide: ~/.copilot/skills/
./scripts/install-copilot.sh --project   # or per project: <project>/.github/skills/
```

On Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-copilot.ps1` (same options, spelled `-Project`).

The script checks for `agy` and `node`, copies `skills/*`, and rewrites the copies only: the companion path becomes absolute (the in-repo relative one breaks the moment a skill is copied out), and every skill is namespaced, so the commands are `/agy-ask`, `/agy-staffer`, `/agy-researcher`, `/agy-reviewer`, `/agy-implementer`. The sources under `skills/` are never modified; re-running the script overwrites the installed copies.

Verify in two steps — first in a terminal, which isolates an agy or auth problem from a Copilot one:

```bash
node /path/to/agy-staff/companion/agy-companion.mjs ask "reply with OK"
```

then restart VS Code and run `/agy-ask reply with OK` in Copilot Chat.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Agent mode is required.** Skills do not load in Ask or Edit mode — switch the Chat mode picker to **Agent** first.
> - **Background jobs mean repeated approvals.** Copilot asks before each terminal command, so one job costs at least two: one to start it, one for the `wait` that collects the result. Only `/agy-ask` is a single foreground call.
> - **Upgrading is manual**: `git pull` in the checkout, then re-run the script. There is no `plugin update` equivalent.

#### For agents

Paste this into any coding agent:

```
Read the raw text of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keli-wen/agy-staff/master/docs/INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md (curl it — do not
work from a summary) and follow it to install and verify the agy-staff plugin for the harness you are running in.
Respond in the user's language.
```

#### Upgrade

Both harnesses install a *copy*, so a new version only reaches you when you pull it in yourself:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update agy-staff && claude plugin update agy@agy-staff
```

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade && codex plugin add agy@agy-staff  # then restart Codex
```

Copilot installs a copy too, but by script: `git pull` in your checkout, then re-run `scripts/install-copilot.sh` (or the `.ps1`).

Both harnesses cache per version directory, so an upgrade lands only if the plugin version changed; restart the harness afterwards. If a fix does not show up, see [upgrading](docs/REFERENCE.md#upgrading) — it has the force-refresh command.

### CUJs

Invocation is always explicit — you type the command; the plugin never triggers itself on natural language. Examples use Claude Code's `/agy:…`; in Codex the same skills are `$agy:…`.

| Use case | Invocation |
|---|---|
| Quick second opinion | `/agy:ask what's your backend model` |
| A general task | `/agy:staffer summarize the open TODOs in this repo` |
| Generate an image | `/agy:staffer generate a pixel-art robot mascot, save it as assets/mascot.png` |
| Review the working tree | `/agy:reviewer Review the current working tree` |
| Review a PR | `/agy:reviewer Review PR #730` |
| Review a plan or decision | `/agy:reviewer Challenge the migration plan in docs/plan.md` |
| Survey a topic | `/agy:researcher how does auth work in this repo` |
| Implement a scoped fix | `/agy:implementer fix the flaky retry test` |
| Job ops (wait/status/cancel/continue) | natural language: "is the agy job done?", "continue: also check the error path" |

`reviewer` is fully prompt-based: you describe the subject and agy gathers the evidence itself (`gh pr view`, `git diff`, reading the file) — there is no flag for handing it a diff. It has two flavors, routed by subject: code review (severity-ranked findings) and general review (a multi-angle challenge of a plan, design, or decision).

`staffer` also unlocks agy's native tools that no specialist persona covers — notably **image generation** (`generate_image`; verified on agy v1.1.15, a 1024×1024 PNG in ~30s).

`ask` answers in the same call. The other personas run as background jobs: the call returns a job id and prints the exact collect command (`wait <id> --timeout <n>m`); your agent runs that in the background — one wait per job — and delivers the result when it finishes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — issues, bug reports and pull requests all help.

Three things worth knowing before you open a PR:

- **Run the tests**: `node --test tests/*.test.mjs`. They are black-box tests against a fake `agy` (`tests/fake-agy.mjs`) in a throwaway repo and HOME, so they never hit the network or your real settings. Keep it that way — a test must never invoke the real binary.
- **Docs come in pairs**: `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` and `docs/REFERENCE.md` / `docs/REFERENCE.zh-CN.md` are kept in sync. Change one, change its counterpart.
- **Behaviour lives in one place**: `companion/agy-companion.mjs` holds all of it. The skills are thin shells that call it, and the prompt templates in `templates/` carry the guardrails.

Adding a mode or a flag changes the public surface, so please open an issue first and we can agree on the shape.
